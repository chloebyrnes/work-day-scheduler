# Work Day Scheduler

This was created to be used as a daily planner to create a schedule. 
When you open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top.
When you scroll down, you are presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
Each time a block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When yu click into a time block you may enter an event. Then when you click the save button, the text for that
event is saved in local storage.
When you refresh the page, the saved events are still there.
